# Models

## Demand

The demand model estimates the internet demand for each point of interest by creating 1 km buffers around the location and counting the population living within those buffers. Population data is sourced from [WorldPop](https://www.worldpop.org/), a leading provider of high-resolution global population datasets. To estimate internet demand, the model multiplies the population within the buffer by the scenario parameter `Demand per user (Mbps)`.

## Fiber

The fiber path model identifies the shortest and most cost-effective paths for connecting unconnected points of interest (POIs) to the existing optical fiber network using the road network. By minimizing the total length of fiber required, this model reduces overall deployment costs while efficiently extending connectivity.

One of the key features of the model is economies of scale: POIs can act as relay points for neighboring POIs, enabling connectivity without each one needing to connect directly to a transmission node. This approach optimizes resource usage and simplifies network expansion.

The model uses Kruskal's algorithm to compute a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST). The graph consists of the road network as edges and POIs as vertices. Connections between POIs and the road network are established using straight-line links. The MST ensures the minimal fiber path necessary to connect all relevant points while adhering to road network constraints.

### Feasibility

Fiber is considered a feasible technology for a POI if the algorithm is able to connect that POI to the fiber network, given the algorithm constraints - particularly the maximum length of fiber allowed per connection. In practice, fiber will not be feasible for POIs that are very far away from transmission nodes or other POIs.

### Required data inputs

- Points of interest
- Transmission nodes

### Model parameters

| Description | Example value |
|------------|---------------|
| Maximum connection length (meters) | 50,000 |
| Annual hardware maintenance and replacement costs (USD per year​, as a fraction of hardware CAPEX) | 0.1 |
| Access bandwidth cost (USD per Mbps per year) | 31.8 |
| Transit bandwidth cost (USD per Mbps per year) | 12 |
| Fiber cost (USD per km​) | 8,000 |
| Hardware setup cost (USD per POI​) | 500 |
| Hardware refresh after (Years) | 3 |

### Cost model

The fiber cost model is summarized below. The CAPEX cost for each POI is dependent on the amount of fiber required to connect that school.

## Cellular

The cellular model relies on coverage analysis. In the current version of the platform, coverage is determined by the distance from a cell tower. Each tower is assumed to provide coverage within a specified maximum radius, which is controlled by the model parameter Coverage radius around cell tower (meters).

### Feasibility

Cellular is considered a feasible technology for a POI if it is within close enough distance to a cell site.

### Required data inputs

- Points of interest
- Cell sites

## Point-to-point

The point-to-point model evaluates the feasibility of establishing radio links between points of interest (POIs) and cell sites using visibility analysis. This involves assessing whether the line of sight between a POI and a cell site is obstructed, ensuring that only feasible links are considered for deployment. The analysis uses open topography data from the [Shuttle Radar Topography Mission](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/data/instruments/srtm) (SRTM), which provides 30-meter resolution elevation data. The maximum visibility limit is set at 35 kilometers.

### Feasibility

Point-to-point microwave is considered a feasible technology for a POI if at least one cell site (or another POI) is visible from the POI.
