About the ITU Connectivity Planning Toolkit The Connectivity Planning Toolkit is an easy-to-use mapping and analysis tool designed to help planners connect schools, hospitals, residential buildings, and other places to the internet. By assessing various technology options like fiber, cellular networks, point-to-point microwave, and satellite, the toolkit identifies the best way to bring connectivity to unconnected areas. The toolkit evaluates the costs of each solution and provides a deployment plan that meets the cost limits you set. You can also customize the tool with your own data\u2014uploading details about the locations of points of interest, ICT infrastructure, and mobile coverage. Additionally, it uses open data on population and topography to enrich the analysis, making it a powerful solution for planning affordable, efficient internet connectivity. The Model Before starting an analysis, you\u2019ll need to select a scenario , such as \"Minimize Total Cost of Ownership.\" Then, set up the scenario parameters , including details like the total budget and the planning period. Each scenario is made up of multiple models \u2014one for each technology option. These models serve two purposes: they evaluate whether the technology is feasible and calculate the cost of deploying it. Each model comes with its own model parameters that guide the analysis and uses datasets containing information about points of interest, ICT infrastructure, and mobile coverage.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#welcome-to-the-itu-connectivity-planning-toolkit","text":"The Connectivity Planning Toolkit (CPT) can be accessed here .","title":"Welcome to the ITU Connectivity Planning Toolkit"},{"location":"#about-the-itu-connectivity-planning-toolkit","text":"The Connectivity Planning Toolkit is an easy-to-use mapping and analysis tool designed to help planners connect schools, hospitals, residential buildings, and other places to the internet.

Population data is sourced from WorldPop , a leading provider of high-resolution global population datasets. To estimate internet demand, the model multiplies the population within the buffer by the scenario parameter Demand per user (Mbps) . Fiber The fiber path model identifies the shortest and most cost-effective paths for connecting unconnected points of interest (POIs) to the existing optical fiber network using the road network. By minimizing the total length of fiber required, this model reduces overall deployment costs while efficiently extending connectivity. One of the key features of the model is economies of scale: POIs can act as relay points for neighboring POIs, enabling connectivity without each one needing to connect directly to a transmission node. This approach optimizes resource usage and simplifies network expansion. The model uses Kruskal's algorithm to compute a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST). The graph consists of the road network as edges and POIs as vertices. Connections between POIs and the road network are established using straight-line links. The MST ensures the minimal fiber path necessary to connect all relevant points while adhering to road network constraints. Feasibility Fiber is considered a feasible technology for a POI if the algorithm is able to connect that POI to the fiber network, given the algorithm constraints - particularly the maximum length of fiber allowed per connection. In practice, fiber will not be feasible for POIs that are very far away from transmission nodes or other POIs. Required data inputs Points of interest Transmission nodes Model parameters Description Example value Maximum connection length (meters) 50,000 Annual hardware maintenance and replacement costs (USD per year\u200b, as a fraction of hardware CAPEX) 0.1 Access bandwidth cost (USD per Mbps per year) 31.8 Transit bandwidth cost (USD per Mbps per year) 12 Fiber cost (USD per km\u200b) 8,000 Hardware setup cost (USD per POI\u200b) 500 Hardware refresh after (Years) 3 Cost model The fiber cost model is summarized below. The CAPEX cost for each POI is dependent on the amount of fiber required to connect that school. Cellular The cellular model relies on coverage analysis. In this version of the toolkit, coverage is determined by the distance from a cell tower. Each tower is assumed to provide coverage within a specified maximum radius, which is controlled by the model parameter Coverage radius around cell tower (meters). Feasibility Cellular is considered a feasible technology for a POI if it is within close enough distance to a cell site. Required data inputs Points of interest Cell sites Model parameters Description Example value Coverage radius around cell tower (meters) 1,000 Reinvest into hardware after (USD per year, as a fraction of hardware CAPEX) 0.1 Access ISP fees (USD per Mbps per year) 24 Annual traffic fee (USD per Mbps per year) 12 Hardware setup cost (USD per POI) 80 Reinvest into hardware after (Years) 3 Cost model The cellular cost model is summarized below. Point-to-point The point-to-point model evaluates the feasibility of establishing radio links between points of interest (POIs) and cell sites using visibility analysis. This involves assessing whether the line of sight between a POI and a cell site is obstructed, ensuring that only feasible links are considered for deployment. The analysis uses open topography data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), which provides 30-meter resolution elevation data. The maximum visibility limit is set at 35 kilometers. Feasibility Point-to-point microwave is considered a feasible technology for a POI if at least one cell site (or another POI) is visible from the POI. Required data inputs Points of interest Cell sites Model parameters Description Example value Bandwidth per access link (MHz) 10 Access link cost (USD per hop) 831.59 Annual hardware maintenance and replacement costs (USD per year, as a fraction of hardware CAPEX) 0.004 Access ISP fees (USD per Mbps per year) 24 Annual recurring license fee for 1MHz (USD per MHz per year) 100 Annual traffic fee (USD per Mbps per year) 12 Bandwidth per backhaul link (MHz) 20 Backhaul links (Links) 0 Backhaul links cost (USD per hop) 2,825.07 Hardware setup cost (USD per POI) 500 One time license fee for 1MHz (USD per MHz) 500 Reinvest into hardware after (Years) 5 Retransmission towers cost (USD per tower) 13,000 Retransmission towers (Towers) 0 Cost model The point-to-point cost model is summarized below. There are added complexities in this cost model due to the presence of additional physical infrastructure, such as retransmission towers and backhaul links - as well as additional one-time and annual license fees. Satellite There is no specific analysis used to assess the feasibility of satellite connections. They are considered always feasible in this version of the toolkit. Feasibility Satellite connections are always considered feasible.
